Lab 7 Beta
Modeling and Storing Data

Slide 3:
Fill in the Stretch Goal
The wording on the slide isn't really clear. What exactly is the stretch goal?
Also, maybe mention the stretch goal later in the slides. At this point, I don't think it's really clear what they are supposed to be doing. I think the slide will be pretty meaningless to most people (schema, extend schema, references, etc)

Slide 4
"Model and store the blog posts" Will this wording be clear to students? What does modeling and storing a blog post mean?

Slide 5:
Why is BlogPost one word? It's because we are talking about the model here. Why don't you just say, "What makes up a BlogPost," then when you talk about actually writing stuff up in code, you can write it as BlogPost (for example in slide 6)

Slides 5 and 6 - good connection

Slide 8 - Good reasoning for why we need a DB. Nitpicky, but it looks like there aren't that many reasons, since there's so much extra space at the bottom of the slide. Maybe add more spacing between the two reasons.

Slide 14 - I really like this explanation of schemas.

Slide 16 - I assume you'll be including an actual "Stretch Goal Hint". Oh wait, you meant that as a reference to the Stretch Goal slide. Got it. I guess it will make more sense when you talk in class.

Rest of concept slides are great!



Slide 3:
Add comments to “blog” instead of “Add comments to project.” Maybe just me, but it just sounds like add debugging comments.
